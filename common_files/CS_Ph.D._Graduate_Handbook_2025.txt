Course Title: Real-Time Systems
Description: Real-Time systems are becoming pervasive. Typical examples of real-time systems include Air Traffic Control Systems, Networked Multimedia Systems, Command Control Systems etc. In a Real-Time System the correctness of the system behavior depends not only on the logical results of the computations, but also on the physical instant at which these results are produced. Real-Time systems are classified from a number of viewpoints i.e. on factors outside the computer system and factors inside the computer system. Special emphasis is placed on hard and soft real-time systems. A missed deadline in hard real-time systems is catastrophic and in soft real-time systems it can lead to a significant loss. Hence predictability of the system behavior is the most important concern in these systems. Predictability is often achieved by either static or dynamic scheduling of real-time tasks to meet their deadlines. Static scheduling makes scheduling decisions at compile time and is off-line. Dynamic scheduling is online and uses schedulability test to determine whether a set of tasks can meet their deadlines. In this course, students will learn the concepts of real-time system and use them to design real-time systems.
