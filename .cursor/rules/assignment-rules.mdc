- Folder structure:
    The project includes the `common_files` folder, the `template` folder, and all course-specific folders. Course folders should be named CourseCode-CourseTitle (e.g., CSC6001-AlgorithmAnalysis), with the Code and title found in `common_files\hand_book`.
    `common_files` include useful course information and some non-task-specific code (e.g., plotting styles, table generation)
    the `template` serves as a template for a course folder
    each course folder should include 1. a assignment prompt file folder, 2. a code folder, 3. data and results (mainly images) folders under the code folder; 4. LaTeX code; 5. Conda environment configuration (`environment.yml`, as each course project's environment is managed separately). Each course may have multiple assignments, all placed in the same project folder.

- Conda Environment Configuration:
    The template includes a basic Conda environment template, containing the most fundamental libraries. Each course project has its own Conda environment, configured according to assignment requirements.

- Git Tracking:
    Ensure all files that should be uploaded to GitHub are properly tracked.

- MCP Rules:
    You can use the pdf-reader-mcp to read the assignment prompts. When uploading file, use relative paths in windows format.
